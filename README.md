# EXPRESS TYPESCRIPT ESBUILD HEXAGONAL

This project is a boilerplate for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications using Express, TypeScript, and Esbuild. It follows the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) to promote clean code, separation of concerns, and testability. The setup ensures fast builds and modern JavaScript features with Esbuild.
